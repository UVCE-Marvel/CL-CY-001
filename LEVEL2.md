## TASK 1: AWS Lambda
AWS Lambda is an event-driven, serverless Function as a Service (FaaS) provided by Amazon as a part of Amazon Web Services. It is designed to enable developers to run code without provisioning or managing servers. It executes code in response to events and automatically manages the computing resources required by that code. From this task, you will learn the basics of running code on AWS Lambda without provisioning or managing servers.  

**Task Outcome**: Deploy the chat app using AWS Lambda.

## TASK 2: CI/CD (Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery) - Intro to Jenkins
In this task, you will explore the concept of Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) and gain an introduction to Jenkins, a popular open-source tool for automating CI/CD pipelines.  

**Task Outcome**:  
- Create a `Jenkinsfile` which contains the scripts for your pipeline.  
- Define the stages in your pipeline. A stage is a group of tasks that are executed together.  
- Define the tasks within each stage. A task is a specific action that is performed in your pipeline, such as building code or running tests.  
- Explore various stages of a CI/CD pipeline (checkout, build, test, deploy).  
- Save the `Jenkinsfile` to your repository.

## TASK 3: SSH
Secure Shell (SSH) is a network communication protocol that enables two computers to communicate.  

**Task Outcome**: Write a script to SSH into a server, search the entire server for public/private keys, and upload them to another server.

## TASK 4: Terraform
Terraform creates and manages resources on cloud platforms and other services through their application programming interfaces (APIs). Providers enable Terraform to work with virtually any platform or service with an accessible API.  

**Task Outcome**: Build, change, and destroy AWS infrastructure using Terraform. Complete the step-by-step, command-line tutorials linked below which will walk you through the Terraform basics.

## TASK 5: Wireshark
Wireshark is a free and open-source packet analyzer. It is used for network troubleshooting, analysis, software and communications protocol development, and education. Learn about network trafficking, fundamentals of Wireshark Analysis, and identify potential security threats.  

**Task Outcome**:  
- Diagnose problems like latency, packet loss, or retransmissions.  
- Look for packets marked with issues (e.g., retransmissions or duplicate acknowledgments).  
- Use tools like the "Statistics" menu to view summaries and graphs.

## TASK 6: Docker
Docker can package an application and its dependencies in a virtual container that can run on any Linux, Windows, or macOS computer. This enables the application to run in a variety of locations, such as on-premises, in public (see decentralized computing, distributed computing, and cloud computing) or private cloud.  

**Task Outcome**: Learn about Docker containers, images, and Dockerfiles. Complete the below Docker getting started course.

## TASK 7: Docker File Spyware
While a Dockerfile itself isn't spyware, it can be used to build Docker images that contain malicious code.  

**Task Outcome**: Write a Dockerfile spyware that constantly monitors a folder and sends all images posted into that folder to another server.

## TASK 8: Web Scraping and Automation - Flight Ticket Price Analysis
While planning a vacation, we all desire to spend the minimum on flight tickets, but it is not always possible. Occasionally, the prices go significantly down at odd timings. If you could understand them, it would mean you will get the chance of booking your tickets near your travel date.  

**Task Outcome**: For this task, pick a website like Expedia or Kayak, fill in your details using an automated fashion, and then crawl the website to extract the price information.  

**Recommended Web Scraping Tool**: Python’s Selenium is suitable for performing web scraping in this project. Additionally, you can use Python’s `smtplib` package to send an email containing the information that you extracted from the website to yourself.

## TASK 9: Hashing
Hashing is the practice of transforming a given key or string of characters into another value for the purpose of security. Unlike standard encryption, hashing is always used for one-way encryption, and hashed values are very difficult to decode.  

**Task Outcome**:  
- Create a simple program to store and verify user passwords securely.  
- Use a library like `hashlib` to hash passwords.  
- Store the hashed passwords in a dictionary or file.  
- Allow users to input their passwords for authentication.

## TASK 10: NMap
Nmap (Network Mapper) is a powerful and widely used open-source tool for network discovery and security auditing.  

**Task Outcome**:  
- Learn how NMap works.  
- Scan the ports, Host, and OS and output these details in a file.  
- Analyze the results and report what you have found.
