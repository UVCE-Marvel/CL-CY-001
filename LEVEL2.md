Exploring Serverless Computing Concepts:
Learn about serverless computing and its benefits, such as scalability and cost-effectiveness.
Explore serverless services like AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions.


Task Details:

1) Develop a simple web application (e.g., a contact form or a basic CRUD application) using a serverless architecture.
2) Utilize AWS Lambda (for AWS) or Google Cloud Functions (for GCP) to handle the backend logic of the application.
3) Store application data in a cloud-based database service like AWS DynamoDB or Google Cloud Firestore.
4) Set up static website hosting using AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage to host the frontend of the application.


Documentation and Presentation:

Require students to document their project setup, including the architecture diagram and deployment steps.
Ask students to present their project, explaining the serverless architecture and demonstrating the application's functionality.


Expected Task Outcomes:

Understanding of cloud computing principles and services provided by GCP/AWS.
Proficiency in deploying serverless applications using AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions.
Ability to implement a complete web application architecture on a cloud platform.
