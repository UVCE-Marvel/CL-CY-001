## TASK 1: Working of a Version Control
Start by reading and understanding the theory behind version control. Focus on the core concepts such as commits, branches, merges, and the role of repositories in version control.  
Install Git on your machine and initialize a simple repository.  

**Task Outcome**: Practice using Git commands, such as `git branch`, `git merge`, `git revert` and `git cherry-pick`, in a hands-on way. Try working on both local and remote repositories (such as GitHub or GitLab) to see how they interact.

## TASK 6: Socket.IO
Socket.IO allows bi-directional communication between client and server. Bi-directional communications are enabled when a client has Socket.IO in the browser, and a server has also integrated the Socket.IO package. While data can be sent in a number of forms, JSON is the simplest.  

**Task Outcome**: Set up a basic chat application using Node.js and Socket.IO on a Linux system. The application should allow multiple users to connect and exchange messages in real-time.

## TASK 7: OSI
The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model describes seven layers that computer systems use to communicate over a network.  

**Task Outcome**:  
- Research and create a simple visual representation or diagram of the OSI model using a cloud-based diagramming tool like Draw.io.  
- Learn about the OSI architecture along with the protocols, switching, routing, handshakes, and IP addressing.  
- Write a brief explanation of each layer of the OSI model and how it relates to cloud computing!
